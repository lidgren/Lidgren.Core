# Lidgren.Core
Various core functions useful to almost every project; but with an emphasis towards game development.

Goals are:
* No dependencies
* Best possible performance
* No reflection
* Heap allocation free whenever possible
* Simple and self explanatory
* Everything thoroughly unit tested

Non-goals are:
* Compatibility with older frameworks
* Never changing API
